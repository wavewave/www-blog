I start blogging. 

I now need to communicate with people in some ways, especially for 
my development. It is nice to have a blog for me to show and discuss 
what's the underlying idea of my program 
(currently hoodle, HROOT,and some physics programs) and how I 
developed and what's the current direction. I would like to get some comments 
from people in diverse fields. 

This blog setup is kinda minimal, but I like it.  
I use [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), which is a static html+javascript web
site generator. I shamelessly copied a blog setting from [https://github.com/travitch/blog](https://github.com/travitch/blog) without doing much 
modification. (BTW, travitch's blog ([http://nochair.net](http://nochair.net)) is great) When I change 
the blog setting more adequate for my purpose, I will post about it.
