Is Haskell Useful?
------------------

One of the most frequent questions about haskell that arises in many language-related Q&A forums and communities is 
whether haskell is useful and whether haskellers use it in their production setup. This is expected if you first
encounter a certain new interesting language which does not seem to have many users as C/C++/Java/Python. 
Learning a language is an expensive task. So before learning, one tends to ask how much she will get rewarded. 

That was how I thought when I first start to learn haskell in 2009. I got fascinated by the idea of pure functional 
language with non-strict semantics. Haskell community is so vibrant and very welcome to newcomers. Cool interesting 
concepts are around haskell. I love mathematics, and haskell loves mathematics, too. So this is a great language 
to learn. However, I am a theoretical high-energy physicists focusing on the collider phenomenology. In our field, 
haskell is

haskell usefulness. 


what is ROOT 
------------

physicist tool. CERN, Large Hadron Collider. big framework. old
hard to avoid the tool if you are in high energy  physics 



difficulty: 
----------

C++
Haskell is not an object-oriented language. Mismatch in concept
but still it has fairly good match with OOP. 

fficxx : generator tool

embedded DSL : 

cheapest approach for those who knows what is in gears. 


current status
--------------

on-going project. need to be feature-complete.
