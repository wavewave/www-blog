I am happy to announce [Hoodle](http://ianwookim.org/hoodle) v0.2.1.
Important change is now support touch!

Change log: 

- touch support: touch is now used for zooming and panning
- any selected items can be transformed into a link
- layer widget (show current content of layer and navigate other layers)
- very simple versioning support (available under File/Save Version) 
- notify a linked item with transparent yellow box when hovered over
- page arranged at the center not left-upper corner
- rendering improvement especially when a pen stroke is being drawn 
- context menu whenever right-clicking on selected item 

Hope that you will enjoy this!
